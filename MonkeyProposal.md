# Goal
This site will provide information about a lot of different monkeys and allows users to input a social security and credit card number to "donate" to the monkeys. The user will be able to view all the monkeys from th eEncyclopedia page and select individual monkeys to get more specific info. The Donation page will use a form to collect credit card and SS numbers. When a specific monkey is chosen from the Encyclopedia page, it will display all the credit cards and SSNs. 
# Plan
We are going to create an API for the monkeys. It will have a table for the monkeys and a table for the credit/SSNs. We will try to get our own monkey photos from the zoo.

Ben and I are going to try to split it between front end and back end to avoid branching conflicts. We can always help out in different parts if necessary.
# Possible Pages
- Home page - Has a daily monkey image and other random, fun info
- Encyclopedia page - Displays all the monkeys in the database and allows users to select individual monkeys.
- Donation page - Has a form that users can enter credit card and Social Security numbers which will be logged in our database.
